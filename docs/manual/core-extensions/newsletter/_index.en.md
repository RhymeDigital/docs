This allows newsletter and various email recipient lists to be managed in the backend. Sending email newsletters 
directly from the backend is also possible, and the newsletters can be formatted very easily thanks to the Contao 
templating system. Frontend modules for subscribing and unsubscribing are also included and double opt-in is supported by default.
